# Documentation gathered from
* [This page on iFixit telling the Wii Fit Meter uses IrDA](https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/205720/Fit+Meter+IR+emitter+freq#answer205742). This was the spark that leaded me to write this project.
* [The contributers to this project](https://github.com/RedInquisitive/3DS-Remote), because I lost a lot of hope until I encountered that project.
