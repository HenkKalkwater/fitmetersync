# Fit Meter Sync 
This tool syncs your 3DS step meter with the Fit Meter via the IR port of the 3DS.

# Contributing
If you have a Wii Fit Meter and a 3DS (or another way to read data from the fit meter), could you create an Issue with the only issue template right now?

Suggestions about the protocol are welcome, as well as pull requests as long as they are somehow relevant to the roadmap or 

# Requirements
* A 3DS
* A Wii U Fit Meter

# Roadmap

## Before v0.1 <-- We are here
* Document parts of the protocol

## v0.1
